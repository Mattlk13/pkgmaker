## Introduction

The package `pkgmaker` provides implementations of features commonly used when developing R packages:

* Package specific options, with the possibility of defining multiple subsets

* Multiple registries based on the `registry` package

* Unified environment/namespace access functions that work in both production mode (build/check/install) 
and development mode, when loading code with the package `devtools`.   
 
The package `pkgmaker` is available from CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgmaker.
The development project is hosted on `GitHub` at https://github.com/renozao/pkgmaker.
